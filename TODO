This is work in progress, not finished by any means.
As it moves to some (intermediate) finished state this will be populated with real TODO items.

For now, to make sure it is planned, the major TODOs are:

- Create README documenting the build and use of this module.
- Add license when we know what license we should use.
- Make sure copyright statements are correct in source files (there are some but not sure).
- Add tests (not trivial for this thing).
- Programming items:
    - General finishing of the code, in stages.
    - Finalize public interfaces (i.e. functions used by other modules).
    - Implement user/password for each server.
    - Parameterize read/write timeouts.
    - Implement specific log for NATS.
    - Decide if need and implement SSL if we do need it.
    - Further out:
         - improve read/write buffers management.
